data structure programming using CPP, SF networks generation

Examples of data structure: binary search tree, hash table, graph structure with BFS(Breadth First Search) and DFS(Depth First Search). They are basically c++ rewritten versions of c programming language based data structure that I made long time ago when I was a undergraduate student.

generation of SF network(graph) code was made when I was a graduate student after learning C++ programming language. it can generate random scale free sample networks whose degree distribution follows ~K^-d(d: dimension). At the time, a python module, networkX was not able to generate sample networks whose minimum degree is larger than or equal to 2. So, I made it myself using C++ programming language.

This demo is built using Visual Studio Code on Debian 10 linux.

Test system: intel core i3-6300 with nVidia GeForce GTX 1050ti
